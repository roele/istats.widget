---

Made for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

Uses the [iStats Ruby Gem](https://github.com/Chris911/iStats "iStats") to obtain SMC information about your system.


## Requirements

The widget requires the installation of a Ruby Gem to work. Installation of the Gem requires
XCode Command Line Tools installed. Follow the steps to install the gem.

1. Open the Terminal.app
2. Issue the command `xcode-select --install`
3. Issue the command `sudo gem install iStats`
4. Issue the command `$(which istats)` and check for the output.
5. Done.


## Appearance & Options

You can find basic options in the file `index.js` in the top section `ui`. Some tweaks will require you to make
changes in the styles in the bottom section `style` of the file.

* `unit` Temperature unit, either C or F
* `top` or `bottom` Top or Bottom position in px
* `left` or `right` Left or Right position in px
* `color` Donut chart color
* `bgcolor` Donut chart background color
* `width` Donut chart width in px, should be same as `height`

## Troubleshooting

* **The widget does not work and/or shows nothing**  
    * Verify the location of your istats binary by issuing `which istats` in your shell and adapt the `command` property in the `index.js` accordingly.
    * Open `Show Debug Console` to verify if there are errors shown in the `Console` tab. If so please report an issue to https://github.com/roele/istats.widget/issues with the error details.
